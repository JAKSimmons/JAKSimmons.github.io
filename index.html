<h2>Andrew Simmons</h2>

<p> I am a Junior at Bob Jones University pursuing a degree in Flute Performance. I work for Piano Tech as well as the Percussion Moving Crew at the university. I also work at <a href="musicalinnovations.biz"> Musical Innovations</a> in Mauldin as well as teach flute lessons.</p>
<p> I enjoy performing with the University's Wind Band, Flute Choir, and Symphony Orchestra. I have performed with these ensambles for the past three years. Before I came to Bob Jones, I performed with the <a href="gcyo.net">Greenville County Youth Orchestra's Young Artist Orchestra</a> for four years. I also enjoy playing in my church orchestra.</p>
